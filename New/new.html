<li><strong>Bayesian Hierarchical Model and MCMC</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>To develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for multivariate longitudinal data to predict health status, trajectories, and intervention effects at the individual level in PCORI mission.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Healthcare data include DNA sequences, functional images of the brain, patient-reported outcomes, and electronic health records with patients’ sequences of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. are complex, and the standard approaches are not adequate for clinical datasets.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with improved the diagnostic accuracy and predicts treatment effects. Visualizations of posterior distributions to help clinicians and patients to make their decision.</p>
<p>Combining prior knowledge and patient data with evidence predicted the patient’s health status, trajectory, and/or likely benefits of intervention. Use of Bayesian hierarchical regression on multivariate longitudinal patient data (R-packages) developed two-levels (1)time within person and (2) persons within a population along with co-variates and interventions. They combined exogenous (eg, age, clinical history) and endogenous (eg, current treatment) variables on the individual’s multivariate health measurements, with the effects of health measurements at one time on subsequent interventions.</p>
<p>Bayesian hierarchical model provided posterior distribution for predictor variables and an estimate of the marginal distribution of the regression coefficients for each coefficient. A large sample which is based on likelihood dominates the prior distribution for regression coefficients. Bayesian hierarchical model is a likelihood-based approach and uses priors providing sensitivities.</p>
<p>The integration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimated the posterior distributions, and avoided missing data and complex outcome measurements.</p>
<p>Results and application</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied in pneumonia etiology (children), prostate cancer, and mental disorders to identify low-risk patient population</li>
<li>To reduce the risk of over-treatment, complications,adverse effects, and financial burden for patients (Disease Reclassification).</li>
<li>Prostate cancer software implementation within the hospital setup (JHM HER).</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitation:</p>
<p>Models were entirely parametric, and recommended for extensions to nonparametric or more flexible parametric models for neuroimage or genomic data.</p>
<p>Recommendations are to address unmet need across a larger, diverse population, in other diseases (autoimmune diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and diabetes) and to embed tools to acquire and use the most relevant information for a better outcome at an affordable cost. <span class="citation" data-cites="Zeger2020">@Zeger2020</span></p>

<li><strong>Bayesian Inference (parametric vs non-parametric)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>The study calculated the posterior probability of disease diagnosis by applying Bayesian inference to develop two modules comparing parametric (with a fixed set of parameters) and nonparametric distributions (which do not make a priori assumptions). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from two separate diagnostic tests on both diseased and non-diseased populations were used for model development.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Conventional methods based on clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds limit the information captured on the intricate relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative diagnostic test outcomes have some overlap between the diseased and nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse populations. The applicability of the normal distribution (conventional method) is critiqued in dealing with skewness, bimodality, or multimodality.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Bayesian nonparametric (vs parametric) diagnostic modeling is a Flexible distributional modeling for test outcomes; posterior disease probabilities</p>
<p>The study developed models using Bayesian inference for posterior probability calculation in the Wolfram Language by integrating prior probabilities of disease with distributions in both diseased and nondiseased populations. The approach enabled the evaluation of combined data from multiple diagnostic tests and resulted in improved the diagnostic accuracy, precision, and adaptability. The model showed flexibility, adaptability, and versatility in the diagnostic.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Nonparametric Bayesian models were reported a better fit for data distributions given the limited existing literature, and were robust in capturing complex data patterns, producing multimodal probability patterns for disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with parametric models.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reliance on parametric models</p></li>
<li><p>Limited scholarly publications and over-dependence on prior probabilities increase the uncertainties, resulting in broader confidence intervals for posterior probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Systemic bias (unrepresentative datasets) compromises the accuracy of Bayesian calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>For Incomplete datasets, Bayesian methods combined with other statistical and computational techniques could enhance diagnostic capabilities.</p></li>

<li><strong>Bayesian methodology overview (stages, development and advantages)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>The stages of Bayesian analysis are presented here specifying the importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection, and its application across various research fields.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Bayesian statistics is used across different fields (social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) where observed and unobserved parameters exist.</p>
<p>Variable selection- is the process of identifying the sub-set of predictors to include in a model along with determining the functional form of the model especially where a large number of potential predictors are available. Unnecessary variables in a model are associated with issues such as multicollinearity, insufficient samples, overfitting the current data leading to poor predictive performance on new data and making model interpretation more difficult.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Variables selection is best after checking correlations among the variables in the model (Eg: gene-to-gene interaction to predict genes in biomedical research).</p>
<p>When the sample size is small, Bayesian estimation with mildly informative priors is often used. The study describes categories of priors (informative, weakly informative and diffuse) based on the degree of (un)certainty (hyperparameters) surrounding the population parameter. The prior distribution with a larger variance represents a greater amount of uncertainty surrounding. Prior elicitation through experts, generic expert, data-based, sample data using maximum likelihood or sample statistics, etc help construct a prior distribution. A prior sensitivity analysis of the likelihood - examines different forms of the model and assesses how the priors and the likelihood align and impact on posterior estimates, reflecting variations not captured by the prior or the likelihood alone. Prior estimation -allows data-informed shrinkage, regularization or influence algorithms towards a likely high-density region, and improves estimation efficiency.</p>
<p>In a small sample i.e.&nbsp;less information, incorporation of priors strengthens the observed data and lends possible value(s) for the unknown parameter(s). Knowing the exact probabilistic specification of the priors for a complex model with smaller sample sizes is important. Frequentists do not consider the probability of the unknown parameters as useful, and consider to be fixed; likelihood is considered as the the conditional probability distribution p(y|θ) of the data (y), given fixed parameters (θ).</p>
<p>In Bayesian inference, unknown parameters (random variables) have varied values, while the (observed) data have fixed values. The likelihood is a function of θ for the fixed data y. Therefore, the likelihood function summarizes a statistical model that stochastically generates a range of possible values for θ and the observed data y. With priors and the likelihood of the observed data, the resulting posterior distribution provides an estimate of the unknown parameters, capture primary factors to improve our understanding. Monte Carlo technique provides integrals of sampled values from a given distribution through computer simulations. The packages BRMS and Blavaan in R are used for the probabilistic programming language Stan. MCMC algorithm only requires the probability distribution of interest to be specified up to a constant of proportionality and is scalable to high dimensions to obtain empirical estimates of the posterior distribution of interest. Bayesian inference adopts a simulation-based strategy for approximating posterior distributions.</p>
<p>Spatial and temporal variability are factored in Bayesian general linear models. A posterior distribution can simulate new data conditional on this distribution and assess, to providing valid predictions.</p>
<p>Results and application</p>
<p>The Bayesian approach analyzes large-scale cancer genomic data, identifies novel molecular changes in cancer initiation and progression, the interactions between mutated genes and captured mutational signatures, highlighting key genetic interactions components, allowing genomic-based patient stratification both in clinical trials, in the personalized use of therapeutics, and in understanding cancer and its evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>The study proposes strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining a checklist and emphasize on the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence in the future.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>In temporal models, the spatial and/or temporal dependencies (autocorrelation of parameters over time)is a challenge in posterior inference.The subjectivity of priors is highlighted by critics as a potential drawback of Bayesian methods. <span class="citation" data-cites="VandeSchoot2021">@VandeSchoot2021</span></p>

<li><strong>Bayesian Normal linear regression, Core parametric (conjugate) model with Normal–Inverse-Gamma prior</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>The study emphasizes prior elicitation, analytical posteriors, robustness checks through guidance provided on Bayesian inference by performing Bayesian Normal linear regression in metrology to calibrate instruments to evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons in determining fundamental constants.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Errors are <strong>independent and identically distributed in Gaussian</strong> and variance is unknown and is estimated from data, the relationship between X and Y is statistical, with noise and model uncertainty and the regression can not be treated as a measurement function . There is a need for statistical approaches (likelihood, Bayesian, bootstrap, etc.) to quantify uncertainty Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Bayesian inference accounts for a priori information, and robustifies the analyses. It emphasizes steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) for the model development and about assumptions critical to Bayesian inference.</p>
<p>All unknowns (observables (data) and unobservables such as parameters and auxiliary variables) are considered random, are assigned probability distributions of the available information, and update prior knowledge about the unobservables with information about them contained in the data. The graphical representation of prior distribution and likelihood function, sensitivity analyses, or model checking enhances the elicitation and interpretation process.</p>
<p>For Normal linear regression problems (1) prior distribution - Normal inverse Gamma (NIG) distribution to a posterior is from the same family of (NIG) distribution. The NIG prior with known variance σ2 of observations is a conjugate prior distribution. Vague or non-informative prior distributions can be derived from NIG prior. (2) alternative families of prior distributions (hierarchical priors) assign an additional layer of distributions to uncertain prior parameters or non-parametricriors.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference is influenced by</p>
<p>- the uncertainty in the transformation of prior knowledge to prior distributions</p>
<p>- the assumptions of the statistical model</p>
<p>- the mistakes in data acquisition</p>
<p>Results and Application</p>
<p>The knowledge from related previous experiments (Normal inverse Gamma distributions) allows for analytic posterior calculations of many quantities of interest. <span class="citation" data-cites="Klauenberg2015">@Klauenberg2015</span></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Bayesian Hierarchical / meta-analytic linear regression and priors (exchangeable and unexchangeable)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>The study developed a test of a formal method for augmenting data in linear regression analyses, by incorporating both exchangeable and unexchangeable information on regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>The frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for the published results and summary statistics from similar previous studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and precision of the parameter estimates resulting in lower values than they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain and are affected by sampling variation.</p>
<p>Multiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different studies have different sets of statistically significant predictors, and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically unrealistic.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Bayesian linear regression accommodates prior knowledge. To overcome the absence of formal studies, it handles the issue of increasing the sample size, and augments the data of a new study with regression coefficients and standard errors from previous similar studies.</p>
<p>To solve the issue of the univariate case analysis, Bayesian linear regression combines the evidence of specific predictors from different linear regression analyses (meta-analysis) to resolve the issue of simultaneously combining multiple regression parameters per study, which ignore the relationship between the regression coefficients.</p>
<p>Adding summary statistics from previous studies in Bayesian linear regression provide a more acceptable solution esp.&nbsp;when previous study data are not (realistically) obtainable.</p>
<p>Based on the information of predictors from previous and current data, the models are categorized into (1) Exchangable - when the current data and previous studies have the same set of predictors. (2) Unexchangable – when the predictors were different in the two.</p>
<p>The steps to Bayesian linear regression steps are mentioned here that yield the posterior density reflecting the updated knowledge about the model parameters after having observed the data,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To calculate the probability density function for the data, given the unknown model parameters;</p></li>
<li><p>The likelihood function - that quantifies what is assumed to be known about the model parameters before observing the data. The Standard multiple linear regression model, integrate the prior, and provide the joint posterior density using the Gibbs sampler.</p></li>
<li><p>A hierarchical model version is used to analyze parameters where studies are under not-exchangeable category.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Incorporating priors in a linear regression on new data yield a significantly better parameter estimate with an adequate approximation. Encouraging performance gains and the large effects are obtained when the data from previous studies are incorporated. Performance of the two versions (exchangeable and unexchangeable) of the replication model was consistently superior to using the current data alone. The model using exchangeable and unexchangeable prior offers better parameter estimates in a linear regression setting without the need to expend a large amount of time and energy to obtain data from the previous studies.</p>
<p>Hierarchical unexchangeable model version offers the advantage of being able to address questions about differences between studies and thus allows for explicit testing of the exchangeability assumption.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>All studies need to have the same set of predictors.</li>

<li><strong>Bayesian logistic regression (Bayesian GLM) (Sequential clinical reasoning approach)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>To study was conducted on a longitudinal prospective cohort to develop a model to predict the risk of incident cardiovascular disease. They incorporated (1) demographic features (basic) (2) six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score) (3) conventional risk factors (enhanced model)</p>
<p>The application of Logistic Regression included priors on coefficients and sequential updating to predict Individual-level CVD risk.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Early diagnosis of at risk population (CVD), impacts health interventions. Limited availability of molecular information in clinical practice (high cost and unavailability) affects efficient disease diagnosis.</p>
<p>It is required to have an alternative approach to analyze data to efficiently identify a high-risk population based on the routinely checked biological markers before doing these expensive molecular tests.</p>
<p>The tailored Framingham Risk Score method, is not sufficient because of the differences present in ethnic groups, location, and socio-economic status, and require the construction of their own models. Heterogeneity (geographic, ethnic group, variations, and different characteristics of social contextual network) often is unobservable and unmeasurable.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>The subjects enrolled in a screening program (Keelung Community) for mass screening (20–79 years) in the Keelung city of Taiwan, were analyzed for 5 years to identify incident cancers and chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease).</p>
<p>The study was able to classify the risk of having incident CVD cases by (1) available and calculated standardized risk score of the MetS components (fasting glucose, blood pressure, HDL-C, triglyceride and waist circumference) (2) together with conventional risk factors (gender, heredity, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of parent’s CVD and betel quid and other factors).</p>
<p>Emulating a clinician’s evaluation process, the Bayesian clinical reasoning approach in a sequential manner was developed and applied in three models.</p>
<p>The Bayesian clinical reasoning approach considered the normal distribution of regression coefficients of all predictors, allowing for uncertainty of clinical weights. The credible intervals of predicted risk estimates were obtained by averaging out. In the model, the individual risk is elicited by prior speculation (first impression) that is updated by objective observed data (patient’s history and laboratory findings), the regression coefficients for computing risk score were treated as random variable with a certain statistical distribution (e.g. normal distribution) rather than a fixed value (traditional risk prediction model by frequentist). The updated prior distribution with the likelihood of the current data provided a posterior distribution to predict the risk for a specific disease. The sequential approach included -</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Basic model developed via logistic regression used prior information constructed on gender, age, age2, and time period.</li>
<li>The Classical model (metabolic score model: MS model) included six MetS components.</li>
<li>The third (enhanced model) incorporated information on smoking, drinking, betel-quid, and family history of CVD.</li>
</ol>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Compared to the basic model and classical model, the enhanced model had better performance. The proposed models predicted CVD incidence at the individual level by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. Patients’ background significantly contributes to baseline risk. Even with ecological heterogeneity, the regression model adopts individual characteristics and makes individual risk prediction for the CVD incidence.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the interactions between age, gender, metabolic score, and other risk factors should be included.</li>
<li>The use of an enhanced model should be validated through external validation by applying the proposed models to new subjects not included in the training of the model parameters. <span class="citation" data-cites="Liu2013">@Liu2013</span></li>

<li><strong>Bayesian parameter estimation in discrete Weibull regression</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What is the goal of the paper?</p>
<p>The study provided the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation in discrete Weibull regression conditioned on the predictors under a uniform non-informative prior, to produce posterior distribution. The model promises its wide applicability to analyze count data using R package BDWreg.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Discrete data (eg: quality of care, planning capacity within a hospital, the number of visits to a specialist and genomic data) are often highly-skewed distributions.</p>
<p>How is it solved?</p>
<p>Similarly to Weibull regression for lifetime data analysis and survival analysis for continuous response variables, a regression model for a discrete variable based on the discrete Weibull distribution report a good fit in comparison with other distributions for count data.</p>
<p>Features of discrete Weibull distribution such as -Poissonmixtures, -Poisson-Tweedie, -zero-inflated semi-parametric regression and -COMPoisson -the ability to capture both over and under-dispersion and a closed-form analytical expression of the quantiles of the conditional distribution make it an alternative to the more traditional Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions.</p>
<p>Non-informative priors and the Laplace priors with a hyper penalty parameter calculated posterior distribution which is proper with finite moments under a uniform non-informative prior.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The advantage of Bayesian approaches over classical maximum likelihood inference are: (1) the possibility of taking prior information into account, such as sparsity or information from historical data, (2) the procedure returns automatically the distribution of all parameters, from which credible intervals can easily be obtained.</p>
<p>Application</p>
<p>The study compared the proposed model with the Bayesian Poisson (BPoisson), Bayesian Negative Binomial (BNB) models and Bayesian DW model on three datasets (inhaler use, health survey, health registry), where BDW(regQ,β) models showed superior performance to the other models. The Bayesian discrete Weibull model shows applicability in analysing count data from the medical domain.@Haselimashhadi2018</p>
<p>8.Bayesian Multiple Imputation and Logistic regression</p>
<p>Missing data, common occurrence in clinical research occurs when the values of the variables of interest are not measured or recorded for all subjects in the sample due to - (i) patient refusal to respond to specific questions (ii) loss of patient to follow-up; (iii)investigator or mechanical error (iv) physicians not ordering certain investigations for some patients</p>
<p>The study mention the importance of understanding the type of missing data (MAR, MNAR, MCAR), based on the type missing data, Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach for addressing the presence of missing data. Mi provides multiple plausible values of a given variable imputed or filled in for each subject who has missing data for that variable. This results in the creation of multiple completed data sets.</p>
<p>With this approach identical statistical analyses are conducted in each of these complete data sets. The pooled results from across complete data sets, are then analyzed.</p>
<p>The study introduces MI, its implementation, developing the imputation model, emphasizing number of imputed data sets to create, and addresses derived variables.</p>
<p>They provided application of MI through an analysis on patients hospitalized with heart failure to estimate the probability of 1-year mortality in the presence of missing data using (R, SAS, and Stata)<span class="citation" data-cites="Austin2021">@Austin2021</span></p>
