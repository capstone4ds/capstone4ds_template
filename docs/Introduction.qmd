# Literature Review 

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health concern closely
associated with factors such as obesity, age, race, and gender.
Identifying these associated risk factors is essential for targeted
interventions @DAngelo2025. **Logistic Regression** (traditional) that
estimates the association between risk factors and outcomes is
insufficient in analyzing the complex healthcare data (DNA sequences,
imaging, patient-reported outcomes, electronic health records (EHRs),
longitudinal health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. @Zeger2020.
Classical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) yields unstable results in
samples that are small, have missing data, or presents quasi- and
complete separation.

Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) allow
analysis of multivariate longitudinal healthcare data with repeated
measures within individuals and individuals nested in a population. By
integrating prior knowledge and including exogenous (e.g., age, clinical
history) and endogenous (e.g., current treatment) covariates, Bayesian
models provide posterior distributions and risk predictions for
conditions such as pneumonia, prostate cancer, and mental disorders.
Parametric assumptions remain a limitation of these models.

In Bayesian inference @Chatzimichail2023, Bayesian inference has shown
that parametric models (with fixed parameters) often underperform
compared to nonparametric models, which do not assume a prior
distribution. Posterior probabilities from Bayesian approaches improve
disease classification and better capture heterogeneity in skewed,
bimodal, or multimodal data distributions. Bayesian nonparametric models
are flexible and robust, integrating multiple diagnostic tests and
priors to enhance accuracy and precision, though reliance on prior
information and restricted access to resources can limit applicability.
Combining Bayesian methods with other statistical or computational
approaches helps address systemic biases, incomplete data, and
non-representative datasets.

The Bayesian framework described by @VandeSchoot2021 highlights the role
of priors, data modeling, inference, posterior sampling, variational
inference, and variable selection.Proper variable selection mitigates
multicollinearity, overfitting, and limited sampling, improving
predictive performance. Priors can be informative, weakly informative,
or diffuse, and can be elicited from expert opinion, generic knowledge,
or data-driven methods. Sensitivity analysis evaluates the alignment of
priors with likelihoods, while MCMC simulations (e.g., brms, blavaan in
R) empirically estimate posterior distributions. Spatial and temporal
Bayesian models have applications in large-scale cancer genomics,
identifying molecular interactions, mutational signatures, patient
stratification, and cancer evolution, though temporal autocorrelation
and subjective prior elicitation can be limiting.

Bayesian normal linear regression has been applied in metrology for
instrument calibration using conjugate Normal–Inverse-Gamma priors
@Klauenberg2015. Hierarchical priors add flexibility by modeling
uncertainty across multiple levels, improving robustness and
interpretability. Bayesian hierarchical/meta-analytic linear regression
incorporates both exchangeable and unexchangeable prior information,
addressing multiple testing challenges, small sample sizes, and complex
relationships among regression parameters across studies @DeLeeuw2012a

**A sequential clinical reasoning model** @Liu2013 Sequential clinical
reasoning models demonstrate screening by adding predictors stepwise:
(1) demographics, (2) metabolic components, and (3) conventional risk
factors, incorporating priors and mimicking clinical evaluation. This
approach captures ecological heterogeneity and improves baseline risk
estimation, though interactions between predictors and external
cross-validation remain limitations.

**Bayesian multiple imputation with logistic regression** addresses
missing data in clinical research @Austin2021 in clinical research by
classifying missing values (e.g., patient refusal, loss to follow-up,
mechanical errors) as MAR, MNAR, or MCAR. Multiple imputation generates
plausible values across datasets and pools results for reliable
classification of patient health status and mortality.
