    "text": "Aims\nThis study aims to apply Bayesian logistic regression to predict diabetes status and examine its association with body mass index (BMI), age (≥20 years), gender, and race using data from the 2013–2014 NHANES survey. The NHANES dataset employs a complex sampling design involving stratification, clustering, and oversampling of specific population subgroups. By adopting a Bayesian analytical framework, this study seeks to overcome challenges commonly encountered in traditional logistic regression—such as missing data, separation, and biases introduced by complete case analysis—thereby improving the efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of model estimates in predicting population-level health outcomes."

We restricted the sample to adults (age ≥ 20) for subsequent analyses that included demographic and anthropometric measures to provide a representative sample for assessing diabetes risk across the U.S. adult population reflecting the complex, multistage sampling design of NHANES.\nStudy Cohort - 25% of columns are discrete (categorical), 75% are continuous (age and BMI). - 92.7% of rows have complete information for all variables with fully observed data across predictors and outcomes for most participants. - The adult cohort includes standardized variables for age and BMI (age_c, bmi_c), categorical indicators for sex and race/ethnicity, and a binary doctor-diagnosed diabetes. - The adult cohort included 5,769 adults aged 20–80 years with the mean age of participants was 49.1 years (SD = 17.6), and participants are fairly evenly distributed across adult age groups, with no sharp skewness. - The mean BMI was 29.1 kg/m² (SD = 7.15), with values ranging from 14.1 to 82.9 kg/m².A small proportion of missing values in variables (BMI and diabetes status). BMI data were available for 5,520 participants, with 249 missing values. BMI: Most participants have BMI values within the normal to overweight range, with fewer in the obese category. - Sex: Sample includes a higher proportion of females than males.\n\n\nVisualization on prevalence of diabetes\n(1) Diabetes by BMI categories: Individuals diagnosed with diabetes\n    tend to have higher BMI values compared to non-diabetics.\n(2) Diabetesby Age Group: The proportion of diabetes increases with\n    advancing age, highlighting age as a strong risk factor.\n(3) Diabetes by Race/Ethnicity: Differences are observed across\n    racial/ethnic groups, with some showing higher prevalence rates\n    than others.\n(4) Diabetes diagnosis by sex across different racial groups.

Other Hispanics have exp(0.56) = 1.75× higher odds Non-Hispanic Blacks have exp(0.68) = 1.97× higher odds. Those identifying as “Other/Multi-racial” have exp(0.75) = 2.12× higher odds of diabetes.\nInterpretation - Age and BMI are strong positive predictors of diabetes — each 1 SD increase in these variables substantially raises the odds. - Sex: Females show significantly lower odds compared to males. - Race/Ethnicity: All non-White racial groups have significantly higher odds of diabetes, highlighting persistent disparities in diabetes risk. - Model significance: All predictors are statistically significant (p &lt;

outcome.\nBMI showed a negative association in most draws, with posterior estimates ranging roughly from 0.61 to 0.70, indicating that higher BMI is associated with lower odds of the outcome in this analysis.\nAge showed a positive association, with posterior estimates ranging roughly from 1.00 to 1.14, suggesting that higher age increases the odds of the outcome.\nThese posterior estimates reflect both the central tendency and variability in the effect of BMI and age, highlighting their roles as important predictors in the model.\n\n\n\nPosterior summary\n\nThe posterior summary of the Bayesian model reports the following for each parameter:\nEstimate: The posterior mean of the coefficient, representing the central tendency of the parameter’s distribution.\nEst.Error: The posterior standard deviation, quantifying uncertainty around the estimate.\nQ2.5: The 2.5th percentile of the posterior distribution, representing the lower bound of the 95% credible interval.\nQ97.5: The 97.5th percentile of the posterior distribution, representing the upper bound of the 95% credible interval.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(posterior)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Density overlay for age and bmi\nmcmc_areas(post, pars = c(

BMI, sex, and race/ethnicity.\nThe posterior densities show the range and uncertainty of each coefficient.\nThe 95% credible intervals are clearly depicted by the shaded areas, highlighting which predictors have strong evidence of association with diabetes.\nAge and BMI showed positive associations, female sex showed a negative association, and several racial/ethnic groups had elevated odds relative to the reference group.\nThis visualization provides an intuitive overview of both the magnitude and uncertainty of the model’s estimated effects.\n\n\n\nCode\npredicted &lt;-

estimates, we compared prior vs posterior coefficient distributions for key predictors: BMI and age. 1. Prior Draws - Simulated from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, SD = 1) for both BMI and age coefficients. Represent initial beliefs about coefficient values before seeing the data. 2. Posterior Draws - Extracted from the fitted model (bayes_fit) for b_bmi_c and b_age_c. - Pivoted to long format and labeled as “Posterior”. 3. Visualization Combined prior and posterior draws - Plotted density overlays with facets for BMI and age. - Posterior distributions are narrower and often shifted from prior, reflecting information gained from the data. - Differences between prior and posterior highlight the model’s learning about effect sizes. - Posterior Predictive Proportions of Diabetes - Computed the proportion of diabetes cases (diabetes = 1) for each posterior draw (pp_samples).\nInterpretaion: - Prior vs posterior plots demonstrate that the Bayesian model updates prior beliefs in a data-informed way. - Posterior predictive proportions closely match observed prevalence, supporting model reliability for inference and prediction.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(combined_draws, aes(x = estimate, fill = type)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +\n  facet_wrap(~ term, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Prior vs Posterior Distributions\",\n    x = \"Coefficient estimate\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    fill = \"\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior vs. Posterior Distributions - We visualized the prior and posterior distributions of the BMI and age coefficients. - Priors were centered at 0, reflecting weak prior beliefs about the direction and magnitude of the effects. - Posteriors were shifted away from 0, indicating that the data provided strong evidence for associations with the outcome. - The density plots highlight the uncertainty and magnitude of the estimated effects, with posterior distributions narrower than the priors, demonstrating that the data meaningfully updated our beliefs. - Faceting by term allows comparison of each predictor’s prior and posterior distributions.\n\n\nCode\n# Compute proportion of diabetes=1 for each draw\npp_proportion &lt;- rowMeans(pp_samples)  # proportion of 1's in each posterior draw\n\n# Optional: visualize the posterior probability distribution\npp_proportion_df &lt;- tibble(proportion = pp_proportion)\n\nggplot(pp_proportion_df, aes(x = proportion)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Posterior Distribution of Proportion of Diabetes = 1\",\n    x = \"Proportion of Diabetes = 1\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Distribution of Diabetes Prevalence\n\nA histogram of these values shows the distribution of predicted prevalence calculated for each draw of the Bayesian model (pp_proportion), reflecting uncertainty in the model estimates, central tendency and variability of diabetes prevalence\nMost posterior predictions cluster around 10–11%, indicating good alignment with the observed/imputed data and demonstrating that the model captures the underlying population pattern.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nsvy_mean &lt;- svymean(~diabetes_dx, nhanes_design_adult, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Create summary table\nsummary_table &lt;- tibble(\n  Method = c(\"Survey-weighted mean (NHANES)\", \n             \"Imputed dataset mean\", \n             \"Posterior predictive mean\"),\n  diabetes_mean = c(\n    coef(svy_mean),           # survey-weighted mean\n    mean(adult_imp1$diabetes_dx, na.rm = TRUE),  # imputed dataset\n    mean(pp_proportion)       # posterior predictive mean\n  ),\n  SE = c(\n    SE(svy_mean),             # survey-weighted SE\n    NA,                       # not available for raw mean\n    NA                        # not available for posterior predictive\n  )\n)\n\n# Render table\nkable(summary_table, digits = 4, caption = \"Comparison of Diabetes Prevalence Across Methods\")\n\n\n\nComparison of Diabetes Prevalence Across Methods\n\n\nMethod\ndiabetes_mean\nSE\n\n\n\n\nSurvey-weighted mean (NHANES)\n0.0890\n0.0048\n\n\nImputed dataset mean\n0.1105\nNA\n\n\nPosterior predictive mean\n0.1089\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Diabetes Prevalence Across Methods\n\nThe estimated prevalence of diabetes was consistent across different analytical approaches:\nSurvey-weighted mean (NHANES): 8.9% (SE = 0.0048)\nImputed dataset mean (MICE): 11.1%\nPosterior predictive mean (Bayesian model): 10.95%\n\nThese results indicate that multiple imputation and Bayesian posterior predictions yield slightly higher prevalence estimates than the raw survey-weighted mean, but all methods are broadly consistent.

    "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health concern closely associated with factors such as obesity, age, race, and gender. Identifying these associated risk factors is essential for targeted interventions D’Angelo and Ran (2025). Logistic Regression (traditional) that estimates the association between risk factors and outcomes is insufficient in analyzing the complex healthcare data (DNA sequences, imaging, patient-reported outcomes, electronic health records (EHRs), longitudinal health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. Zeger et al. (2020). Classical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) yields unstable results in samples that are small, have missing data, or presents quasi- and complete separation.\nBayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) allow analysis of multivariate longitudinal healthcare data with repeated measures within individuals and individuals nested in a population. By integrating prior knowledge and including exogenous (e.g., age, clinical history) and endogenous (e.g., current treatment) covariates, Bayesian models provide posterior distributions and risk predictions for conditions such as pneumonia, prostate cancer, and mental disorders. Parametric assumptions remain a limitation of these models.\nIn Bayesian inference Chatzimichail and Hatjimihail (2023), Bayesian inference has shown that parametric models (with fixed parameters) often underperform compared to nonparametric models, which do not assume a prior distribution. Posterior probabilities from Bayesian approaches improve disease classification and better capture heterogeneity in skewed, bimodal, or multimodal data distributions. Bayesian nonparametric models are flexible and robust, integrating multiple diagnostic tests and priors to enhance accuracy and precision, though reliance on prior information and restricted access to resources can limit applicability. Combining Bayesian methods with other statistical or computational approaches helps address systemic biases, incomplete data, and non-representative datasets.\nThe Bayesian framework described by Schoot et al. (2021) highlights the role of priors, data modeling, inference, posterior sampling, variational inference, and variable selection.Proper variable selection mitigates multicollinearity, overfitting, and limited sampling, improving predictive performance. Priors can be informative, weakly informative, or diffuse, and can be elicited from expert opinion, generic knowledge, or data-driven methods. Sensitivity analysis evaluates the alignment of priors with likelihoods, while MCMC simulations (e.g., brms, blavaan in R) empirically estimate posterior distributions. Spatial and temporal Bayesian models have applications in large-scale cancer genomics, identifying molecular interactions, mutational signatures, patient stratification, and cancer evolution, though temporal autocorrelation and subjective prior elicitation can be limiting.\nBayesian normal linear regression has been applied in metrology for instrument calibration using conjugate Normal–Inverse-Gamma priors Klauenberg et al. (2015). Hierarchical priors add flexibility by modeling uncertainty across multiple levels, improving robustness and interpretability. Bayesian hierarchical/meta-analytic linear regression incorporates both exchangeable and unexchangeable prior information, addressing multiple testing challenges, small sample sizes, and complex relationships among regression parameters across studies Leeuw and Klugkist (2012)\nA sequential clinical reasoning model Liu et al. (2013) Sequential clinical reasoning models demonstrate screening by adding predictors stepwise: (1) demographics, (2) metabolic components, and (3) conventional risk factors, incorporating priors and mimicking clinical evaluation. This approach captures ecological heterogeneity and improves baseline risk estimation, though interactions between predictors and external cross-validation remain limitations.\nBayesian multiple imputation with logistic regression addresses missing data in clinical research Austin et al. (2021) in clinical research by classifying missing values (e.g., patient refusal, loss to follow-up, mechanical errors) as MAR, MNAR, or MCAR. Multiple imputation generates plausible values across datasets and pools results for reliable classification of patient health status and mortality."

Posterior distributions were narrower and shifted away from zero relative to the priors, indicating that the data provided substantial evidence for positive associations of BMI and age with diabetes risk. Faceting by predictor enabled clear visual comparison of how each coefficient’s distribution evolved after model updating.\nInterpretation: The shift from diffuse priors to concentrated posteriors demonstrates the model’s ability to incorporate empirical evidence and refine prior beliefs. Narrower posterior distributions reflect reduced uncertainty in parameter estimates. The posterior predictive proportions of diabetes closely matched the observed prevalence in the analytic dataset, supporting the model’s reliability for inference and prediction.\n\n\nModel Comparison\n\nModel Comparison Across all analytic methods: survey-weighted maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), multiple imputation with pooled estimates (MICE), and Bayesian regression shows the associations between BMI, age, and diabetes diagnosis were consistent in direction and magnitude.\nFor BMI, the odds ratios ranged from 1.73 (95% CI: 1.58–1.89) in the MICE-pooled model to 1.89 (95% CI: 1.65–2.15) in the survey-weighted MLE model, and 1.87 (95% CrI: 1.71–2.05) in the Bayesian model.\nFor age, the estimated odds ratios were 2.90 (95% CI: 2.60–3.24) using MICE, 3.03 (95% CI: 2.70–3.40) from the survey-weighted MLE model, and 2.99 (95% CrI: 2.64–3.37) in the Bayesian analysis.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Results\n\n #Build compact results table (BMI & Age only) \nlibrary(dplyr);
