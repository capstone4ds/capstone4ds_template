    "text": "Aims\nThis study aims to apply Bayesian logistic regression to predict diabetes status and examine its association with body mass index (BMI), age (≥20 years), gender, and race using data from the 2013–2014 NHANES survey. The NHANES dataset employs a complex sampling design involving stratification, clustering, and oversampling of specific population subgroups. By adopting a Bayesian analytical framework, this study seeks to overcome challenges commonly encountered in traditional logistic regression—such as missing data, separation, and biases introduced by complete case analysis—thereby improving the efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of model estimates in predicting population-level health outcomes."

    "text": "Bayesian Logistic Regression\nTo estimate the associations between predictors and outcome probabilities. Bayesian framework integrates prior information with observed data to generate posterior distributions, allowing direct probabilistic interpretation of parameters.\nThis approach provides flexibility in model specification, accounts for parameter uncertainty, and produces credible intervals that fully reflect uncertainty in the estimates.\nUnlike traditional frequentist methods, the Bayesian method enables inference through posterior probabilities, supporting more nuanced decision-making and interpretation.\n\nModel Structure\n\nBayesian logistic regression is a probabilistic modeling framework used to estimate the relationship between one or more predictors (continuous or categorical) and a binary outcome (e.g., presence/absence of disease).\n\nIt extends classical logistic regression by combining it with Bayesian inference, treating model parameters as random variables with probability distributions rather than fixed point estimates Leeuw and Klugkist (2012) and Klauenberg et al. (2015)\nBayesian logistic regression models the log-odds of a binary outcome as a linear combination of predictors:\n\n\n\nIn the Bayesian framework, model parameters ( ) are treated as random variables and assigned prior distributions that reflect existing knowledge or plausible ranges before observing the data. After incorporating the observed evidence, the priors are updated through Bayes’ theorem (Leeuw and Klugkist 2012; Klauenberg et al. 2015):\nIn the Bayesian framework, the coefficients () are assigned prior distributions, which are updated in light of the observed data to yield posterior distributions.\nThe Bayesian approach naturally incorporates uncertainty in all model parameters.\n\nIt combines prior beliefs with observed data to produce posterior distributions according to Bayes’ theorem: [ ]\n\nLikelihood: is the probability of the observed data given the model parameters (as in classical logistic regression).\n\nPrior: Encodes prior knowledge or beliefs about parameter values before observing the data.\n\nPosterior: is the updated beliefs about parameters after observing the data.\nPosterior ⋉ Likelihood * Prior\n\n\nPrior Specification - Regression coefficients prior: normal(0, 2.5) — providing weakly informative regularization provide gentle regularization, constraining extreme values without overpowering the data R. van de Schoot et al. (2021) - Intercept prior: Student’s t-distribution prior, student_t(3, 0, 10) (van de Schoot et al., 2013).\nThis weakly informative prior:\n- Has 3 degrees of freedom** (( = 3 )), producing heavy tails that allow for occasional large effects.\n- Is centered at 0 (( = 0 )), reflecting no initial bias toward positive or negative associations.\n- Has a scale parameter of 10 (( = 10 )), allowing broad variation in possible coefficient values.\nSuch priors improve stability in models with small sample sizes, high collinearity, or potential outliers.\n\n\nAdvantages of Bayesian Logistic Regression\n\nUncertainty quantification: Produces full posterior distributions instead of single-point estimates.\nCredible intervals: Provide the range within which a parameter lies with a specified probability (e.g., 95%).\nFlexible priors: Allow incorporation of expert knowledge or results from previous studies.\nProbabilistic predictions: Posterior predictive distributions yield direct probabilities for future observations.\nComprehensive model checking: Posterior predictive checks (PPCs) evaluate how well simulated outcomes reproduce observed data.\n\n\n\nPosterior Predictions\n\nPosterior distributions of the coefficients are used to estimate the probability of the outcome for given predictor values. This enables statements such as:\n “Given the predictors, the probability of the outcome lies between X% and Y%.”\nPosterior predictions incorporate two sources of uncertainty:\n\nParameter uncertainty: Variability in estimated model coefficients.\nPredictive uncertainty: Variability in future outcomes given those parameters.\n\nIn Bayesian analysis, every unknown parameter — such as a regression coefficient, mean, or variance — is treated as a random variable with a probability distribution that expresses uncertainty given the observed data.\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation and Diagnostics\n\nModel quality and convergence are assessed using standard Bayesian diagnostics:\nPosterior inference performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). Four chains run with sufficient warm-up iterations to ensure convergence. Austin et al. (2021)\nConvergence diagnostics: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) performance was evaluated using ( ) (R-hat) and effective sample size (ESS).\nAutocorrelation checks: Ensure independence between successive MCMC draws.\nPosterior predictive checks (PPC): Compare simulated data from posterior distributions to observed outcomes.\nBayesian R²: Quantified the proportion of variance explained by the predictors, incorporating uncertainty."

Posterior distributions were narrower and shifted away from zero relative to the priors, indicating that the data provided substantial evidence for positive associations of BMI and age with diabetes risk. Faceting by predictor enabled clear visual comparison of how each coefficient’s distribution evolved after model updating.\nInterpretation: The shift from diffuse priors to concentrated posteriors demonstrates the model’s ability to incorporate empirical evidence and refine prior beliefs. Narrower posterior distributions reflect reduced uncertainty in parameter estimates. The posterior predictive proportions of diabetes closely matched the observed prevalence in the analytic dataset, supporting the model’s reliability for inference and prediction.\n\n\nModel Comparison\n\nModel Comparison Across all analytic methods: survey-weighted maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), multiple imputation with pooled estimates (MICE), and Bayesian regression shows the associations between BMI, age, and diabetes diagnosis were consistent in direction and magnitude.\nFor BMI, the odds ratios ranged from 1.73 (95% CI: 1.58–1.89) in the MICE-pooled model to 1.89 (95% CI: 1.65–2.15) in the survey-weighted MLE model, and 1.87 (95% CrI: 1.71–2.05) in the Bayesian model.\nFor age, the estimated odds ratios were 2.90 (95% CI: 2.60–3.24) using MICE, 3.03 (95% CI: 2.70–3.40) from the survey-weighted MLE model, and 2.99 (95% CrI: 2.64–3.37) in the Bayesian analysis.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Results\n\n #Build compact results table (BMI & Age only) \nlibrary(dplyr);

This demonstrates good model calibration and predictive validity, while visualizing the uncertainty of both survey-based and model-based estimates.\n\nPractical Implications - Health departments can estimate diabetes burden at the state or county level using Bayesian small-area estimation. - Clinicians and public health researchers can plan targeted screening where predicted prevalence is higher than observed. - Epidemiologists can validate disease models before applying them to regions without survey data.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(posterior)\n\n# Convert fitted model to draws array\npost_array &lt;- as_draws_array(bayes_fit)  # draws x chains x parameters\n\n# Plot autocorrelation for age and bmi\nmcmc_acf(post_array, pars = c(\"b_age_c\", \"b_bmi_c\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCMC Autocorrelation for Key Parameters\nPairwise plots (mcmc_pairs, posterior) explore correlations between parameters. - Autocorrelation plots for the posterior draws of age and BMI coefficients assess chain mixing and convergence showing correlation of each draw with its lagged values across iterations. - Rapid decay of autocorrelation toward zero indicates that the Markov chains are mixing well and successive draws are relatively independent. - Both age and BMI coefficients exhibited low autocorrelation after a few lags, supporting the reliability of posterior estimates. - This diagnostic confirms that the Bayesian model sampling was adequate and stable, ensuring valid inference from the posterior distributions.\n\nAutocorrelation within MCMC samples for a single parameter across iterations — i.e., how strongly each sample depends on its previous ones.\nIt reflects MCMC chain mixing and efficiency, not relationships between parameters\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(bayesplot)\n\n# Extract posterior draws\npost &lt;- as_draws_df(bayes_fit)\n\n# Select numeric parameters of interest\npost_subset &lt;- post %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(b_age_c, b_bmi_c, b_sexFemale, \n                b_raceMexicanAmerican, b_raceNHBlack)\n\n# Compute correlation matrix\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(post_subset)\n\n# Visualize\nmcmc_pairs(as_draws_array(bayes_fit), \n           pars = c(\"b_age_c\", \"b_bmi_c\", \"b_sexFemale\"),\n           off_diag_args = list(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Posterior correlation among parameters (e.g., between b_age_c, b_bmi_c, b_sexFemale)\nEach diagonal panel shows the posterior density (distribution) of one parameter, while the off-diagonal scatterplots show pairwise relationships (correlations) between parameters across posterior draws.\n\n1. Marginal Distributions (diagonals)\n\nThe histograms show that all parameters (b_age_c, b_bmi_c, b_sexFemale) have approximately symmetric and unimodal posterior distributions.\nThis indicates stable and well-identified estimates with no sampling irregularities or multimodality.\nThe narrow spread (small variance) reflects high precision of parameter estimates.\n\n\n\n2. Joint Distributions (off-diagonal scatterplots)\n\nThe scatterplots show elliptical clouds centered around the mean, with no strong linear patterns.\nThis means low posterior correlation among parameters — i.e., b_age_c, b_bmi_c, and b_sexFemale are largely independent in their posterior estimates.\nThe absence of diagonal streaks or skewed clusters suggests that collinearity is minimal and that the MCMC chains successfully explored the parameter space.\n\n\n\n3. Subtle Correlation Notes\n\nA mild negative tilt between b_age_c and b_sexFemale indicates a slight negative correlation, meaning as the posterior estimate for age increases, the effect of being female slightly decreases.\nHowever, this pattern is weak — confirming that both predictors contribute distinct information to the diabetes outcome.\nThe absence of strong linear relationships among parameters suggests that age, BMI, and sex independently contributed to the prediction of diabetes status. The smooth, unimodal histograms along the diagonals confirmed stable model convergence and well-behaved posterior samples."
