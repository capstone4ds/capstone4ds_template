## Introduction

The k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) is an algorithm that is being used in a variety of fields to classify or predict data. The kNN algorithm is a simple algorithm that classifies data based on how similar a datapoint is to a class of datapoints. One of the benefits of using this algorithmic model is how simple it is to use and the fact it’s non-parametric which means it fits a wide variety of datasets. One drawback from using this model is that it does have a higher computational cost than other models which means that it doesn’t perform as well or fast on big data. Despite this, the model’s simplicity makes it easy to understand and easy to implement in a variety of fields. One such field is the field of healthcare where kNN models have been successfully used to predict diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. In this paper we will focus on the methodology and application of kNN models in the field of healthcare to predict diabetes, a pressing public health problem. 

## Literature Review 

The literature review explores the theoretical background of kNN and key factors affecting its performance. Recent advancements in optimizing kNN for large datasets and the role of kNN in medical diagnosis, particularly diabetes prediction.

### Theoretical Background of KNN
 
kNNs are supervised learning algorithms that work by comparing a data point to other similar data points to label it. It works on the assumption that data points that are similar to each other must be close to each other. In the thesis [@zhang2016introduction], the author gave the reader an introduction to how kNN works and how to run a kNN model in R studio. He describes the methodology as assigning an unlabeled observation to a class by using labeled examples that are similar to it. It also describes the Euclidean distance equation which is the default distance equation that is used for kNNs. The author also describes the impact the k parameter has on the algorithm. The k parameter is the parameter that tells the model how many neighbors it will use when trying to classify a data point. Zhang recommends setting the k parameter equal to the square root of the number of observations in the training dataset.

Although Zhang’s recommendation to set the k parameter could be a great starting point, the thesis [@zhang2017efficient] proposed the decision tree-assisted tuning to optimize k, significantly enhancing accuracy.  The authors of this thesis propose using a training stage where we use a decision tree to select the ideal number of k values and thus make the kNN more efficient. The authors deployed and tested two more efficient kNN methods called kTree and the k*Tree methods. They found their method did reduce running costs and increased classification accuracy.

Another big impact on accuracy is the distance the model uses to classify neighbors. Although the euclidean distance is the default distance that is used in kNNs there are other distances that can be used. In the thesis [@kataria2013review] the authors compare different distances in classification algorithms with a focus on the kNN algorithm. It starts off explaining how the kNN algorithm uses the nearest k-neighbors in order to classify data points and then describes how the euclidean distance does this by putting a line segment between point a and point b and then measuring the distance using the euclidean distance formula. It moves on to describe the “cityblock” or taxican distance and describes it as “the sum of the length of the projections of the line segment”. It also describes the cosine distance and the correlation distance and then compares the performance of the default euclidean distance to the performance of using city block, cosine and correlation distances. In the end it found the euclidean distance was more efficient than the others in their observations.

Syriopoulos et al. [@syriopoulos2023k] also reviewed distance metric selection, confirming that Euclidean distance remains the most effective choice for most datasets. However, alternative metrics like Mahalanobis distance can perform better for correlated features. The review emphasized that selecting the right metric is dataset-dependent, influencing classification accuracy.

### Challenges in Scaling kNN for Large Datasets

While kNN is simple and effective, it struggles with computational inefficiency when working with large datasets since it must calculate distances for every new observation. This becomes a major challenge in big data, where the sheer volume of information makes traditional kNN methods slow and resource-intensive.

To address this, Deng et al. [@deng2016efficient] proposed an improved approach called LC-kNN, which combines k-means clustering with kNN to speed up computations and enhance accuracy. By dividing large datasets into smaller clusters, their method reduces the number of distance calculations needed. After extensive testing, the authors found that LC-kNN consistently outperformed standard kNN, achieving higher accuracy and better efficiency. Their study highlights a key limitation of traditional kNN (without optimization, its performance significantly declines on big data) and offers an effective solution to improve its scalability.

Continuing and summarizing these ideas, Syriopoulos et al. [@syriopoulos2023k] explored techniques for accelerating kNN computations, such as:

- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, feature selection) to reduce data complexity.
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods to speed up distance calculations.
- Hybrid models combining kNN with clustering (e.g., LC-kNN) to improve efficiency.

This approach enhanced both speed and accuracy, making it a promising solution for handling large datasets. In addition, the study categorizes kNN modifications into local hyperplane methods, fuzzy-based models, weighting schemes, and hybrid approaches, demonstrating how these adaptations help tackle issues like class imbalance, computational inefficiency, and sensitivity to noise.

Another key challenge for kNN is its performance in high-dimensional datasets. The 2023 study by Syriopoulos et al. evaluates multiple nearest neighbor search algorithms such as kd-trees, ball trees, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and graph-based search methods that enable kNN performance scaling for larger datasets through minimized distance calculations.

The enhancements to kNN have substantially increased its performance in terms of speed and accuracy which now allows it to better handle large-scale datasets. However, as Syriopoulos et al. primarily compile prior research rather than conducting empirical comparisons, further work is needed to evaluate these optimizations in real-world medical classification tasks.

### kNN in Disease Prediction: Applications & Limitations

#### Disease Prediction with kNN

kNN has been widely used for diabetes classification and early detection. Ali et al. [@ali2020diabetes] tested six different kNN variants in MATLAB to classify blood glucose levels, finding that fine kNN was the most accurate. Their research highlights how optimizing kNN can improve classification performance, making it a valuable tool in healthcare.

In turn, Saxena et al. [@saxena2014diagnosis] used kNN on a diabetes dataset and observed that increasing the number of neighbors (k) led to better accuracy, but only to a certain extent. In their MATLAB-based study, they found that using k = 3 resulted in 70% accuracy, while increasing k to 5 improved it to 75%.
Both studies demonstrate how kNN can effectively classify diabetes, with accuracy depending on the choice of k and dataset characteristics. Ongoing research continues to refine kNN, making it a more efficient and reliable tool for medical applications.

Feature selection is another critical factor. Panwar et al. [@panwar2016k] demonstrated that focusing on just BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Function improved accuracy, suggesting that simplifying feature selection enhances model performance.
The study of Suriya and Muthu [@suriya2023type] showed that kNN is a promising model for predicting type 2 diabetes, showing the highest accuracy on smaller datasets. The authors tested three datasets of varying sizes from 692 to 1853 rows and 9-22 dimensions to test the kNN algorithm’s performance and found that the larger dataset requires a higher k-value. Besides, PCA analysis to reduce dimensionality did not improve model performance. This suggests that simplifying the data doesn’t always lead to better results in diabetes prediction.
The same findings about PCA influence on ML models implementation, and kNN in particular, showed in the research of Iparraguirre-Villanueva et al. [@iparraguirre2023application].  Also, they confirmed that kNN alone is not always the best choice. Authors compared kNN with Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Trees. Their results showed that while kNN performed well on balanced datasets, it struggled when class imbalances existed. While PCA significantly reduced accuracy for all models, the SMOTE-preprocessed dataset demonstrated the highest accuracy for the k-NN model (79.6%), followed by BNB with 77.2%. This reveals the importance of correct preprocessing techniques in improving kNN model accuracy, especially when handling imbalanced datasets.

Khateeb & Usman [@khateeb2017efficient] extended kNN’s application to heart disease prediction, demonstrating that feature selection and data balancing techniques significantly impact accuracy. Their study showed that removing irrelevant features did not always improve performance, emphasizing the need for careful feature engineering in medical datasets.

### kNN Beyond Prediction: Handling Missing Data

While kNN is widely known for classification, it also plays a key role in data preprocessing for medical machine learning. Altamimi et al. [@altamimi2024automated]  explored kNN imputation as a method to handle missing values in medical datasets. Their study showed that applying kNN imputation before training a machine learning model significantly improved diabetes prediction accuracy - from 81.13% to 98.59%. This suggests that kNN is not only useful for disease classification but also for improving data quality and completeness in healthcare applications.

Traditional methods often discard incomplete records, but kNN imputation preserves valuable information, leading to more reliable model performance. However, Altamimi et al. (2024) also highlighted challenges such as computational costs and sensitivity to parameter selection, reinforcing the need for further optimization when applying kNN to large-scale medical datasets.

### Comparing kNN Variants & Hybrid Approaches

Research indicate that kNN works well for diabetes prediction, but recent studies demonstrate it doesn't consistently provide the best results. The study by Theerthagiri et al.  [@theerthagiri2022diagnosis] evaluated kNN against multiple machine learning models such as Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) through analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The research indicated that kNN performed adequately but MLP excelled beyond all other algorithms achieving top accuracy at 80.68% and leading in AUC-ROC with an 86%. Despite its effectiveness in classification tasks, kNN's primary limitation is its inability to compete with advanced models like neural networks when processing complex datasets.

In turn, Uddin et al.[@uddin2022comparative] explored advanced kNN variants, including Weighted kNN, Distance-Weighted kNN, and Ensemble kNN. Their findings suggest that:

- Weighted kNN improved classification by assigning greater importance to closer neighbors.
- Ensemble kNN outperformed standard kNN in disease prediction but required additional computational resources.
- Performance was highly sensitive to the choice of distance metric and k value tuning.

Their findings suggest that kNN can be improved through modifications, but it remains highly sensitive to dataset size, feature selection, and distance metric choices. In large-scale healthcare applications, Decision Trees (DT) and ensemble models may offer better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
These studies highlight the ongoing debate over kNN’s role in medical classification - whether modifying kNN is the best approach or if other models, such as DT or ensemble learning, provide stronger performance for diagnosing diseases.

kNN continues to be a valuable tool in medical machine learning, offering simplicity and strong performance in classification tasks. However, as research shows, its effectiveness depends on proper feature selection, optimized k values, and preprocessing techniques like imputation. While kNN remains an interpretable and adaptable model, newer methods - such as ensemble learning and neural networks - often outperform it, particularly in large-scale datasets.
For our capstone project, exploring feature selection, fine-tuning kNN’s settings, and comparing it to other algorithms could give us valuable insights into its strengths and limitations.


## Methods

The kNN algorithm works on the assumption that similar data is close to each other in distance. It classifies a datapoint by using the euclidean distance formula to find the nearest k data specified. Once these k data points have been found, the kNN assigns a category to the new datapoint based off the category with the majority of the data points that are similar. [@zhang2016introduction]
For example, the distance between two data points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) would be calculated by the euclidean distance formula as follows [@theerthagiri2022diagnosis]: 

$$
d = \sqrt{(X_2 - X_1)^2 + (Y_2 - Y_1)^2}
$$

*Where $X_2 - X_1$ calculates the horizontal difference and $Y_2 - Y_1$ calculates the vertical difference. These two distances are then squared to ensure they are positive regardless of which directionality. Squaring the distances also gives greater emphasis to larger distances.* 



## Analysis and Results

cdc_diabetes_health_indicators = fetch_ucirepo(id=891) 
  
# data (as pandas dataframes) 
X = cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.features 
y = cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.targets 
  
```

The following table displays the first few rows of the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. 
```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

cdc_data_df = pd.concat([cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.features, 
                         cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.targets], axis=1)

cdc_data_df.to_csv("cdc_data.csv", index=False)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readr)

cdc_data_df <- read_csv("cdc_data.csv")

exploratory_data_analysis_df=pd.DataFrame(exploratory_data_analysis)

exploratory_data_analysis_df.to_csv("eda.csv", index=False)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(readr)

exploratory_df <- read_csv("eda.csv")

kable(exploratory_df)
```


### Modeling and Results

The ordinal categorical variables include age, education, income and GenHlth. We chose to keep them the same and not do one-hot-encoding because age, education and income had a natural order that had meaningful distances. For example, a bigger number for age or income indicated an older age or a higher income. The dataset also included BMI, MentHlth, and PhysHlth as continuous variables and we normalized them during the pre-processing step. 

```{python}
#import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

#Load dataset 
cdc_diabetes_health_indicators = fetch_ucirepo(id=891)
X = cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.features
y = cdc_diabetes_health_indicators.data.targets

#Normalize Continuous Variables
cont_variables = ["BMI","MentHlth","PhysHlth"]
scaler = StandardScaler()
X[cont_variables]= scaler.fit_transform(X[cont_variables])

#Split data into training and testing data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=100)

# Initialize and train kNN
knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, p=2, metric='minkowski')
knn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Make classifications on testing data 
y_predictions = knn_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_predictions)
print(f"Accuracy of knn model: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
