## Introduction

In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) is of great interest and
much attention for integration in Supply Chain Management, especially
due to the global disruptions in the form of pandemics, geopolitical
insecurity, and technology revolution. With markets becoming more
dynamic and unpredictable; traditional supply chain models have been
unable to ‘amend', so that it matches what is happening in the markets
thereby; it is really important for suppliers to be introduced to
methods of increasing their resilience and overall performance. In my
opinion, the transformed opportunity provided by AI-driven innovations
is through the introduction of advanced analytics, automation and
predictive capabilities to optimize the supply chain operations.

The paper by Belhadi et al. (2024) which reviews the use of AI in
improving Supply Chain Resiliences (SCRes) and Supply Chain Performance
(SCP) in a dynamic market environment is used as the focal point of this
literature review. Thus, this study is presented as an attempt of
filling the gap found in SCP empirical research by SCRes and the direct
and indirect impact of AI on SCP. The authors used an empirical study of
data from manufacturing firms in many industries and in various
locations to perform empirical analysis of the use of the Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to study AI based supply chain
improvements. It is based on these findings that it can be concluded
that SCRes are not only driven by SCP activity but also created by
strengthened SC supply resources’ Adaptive Capabilities (AC) and Supply
Chain Collaboration (SCC). These enablers are acting as such: proactive
risk mitigation, strategic decision making and operational agility in
long terms sustainability of supply chain operations. Moreover, the
study also highlights the moderating role of the Firm’s Supply Chain
Dynamism (SCD) to illustrate how the dynamics in the market conditions
should call for a change in the firm’s AI capabilities.

This review presents the key contributions and the meaning of the study
to the current supply chain problems through its methodological
framework. Finally, this research also has a value at the professional
and researcher communities who are in the efforts of making the supply
chains more resilient and high performing, given the more volatile
business environment, by using such Transformative impacts of AI.

## Background motivation:

As noted by Belhadi et al. (2024), it is crucial to invest more into
understanding how AI can assist supply chain resilience and performance
(SCP), since the dynamism and uncertainty in society are increasing more
and more. However, although the supply chain infrastructure has
undergone extensive strategic planning and is heavily modernized,
current supply chain management methods are found inadequate when faced
with the recent global crises, i.e., pandemics and geopolitical
instability. AI presents interesting solution to the challenges in
information processing and decision making; however, lack of research
specifically focusing on the contribution of AI to SCP boosting through
more SCRes. The gap that this study wishes to fill is to investigate the
direct and indirect impacts of the AI on supply chain operations.

## Methodology:

In order to analyze the validity of the proposed research framework
formulated with the Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT)
in relation to the role of AI in Supply Chain Resilience (SCRes) and
Supply Chain Performance (SCP), this study employs a quantitative
research design based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Data was
collected through a structured survey that was sent to manufacturing
companies located across all the regions, being a supply chain manager,
an executive, or an operational specialist who is involved in supply
chain management of an AI led manner. The four measured factors were
automation, machine learning, predictive analytics and Ai Capabilities
(AI). Supply Chain Resilience (SCRes) has been measured through
indicators specifying the risk management, the adaptive capacity,
response efficiency; Supply Chain Performance (SCP) has been evaluated
taking into account the order fulfillment rate, lead time and cost
efficiency. Market demands change rate, supplier stability,
technological disruption were measured as supply chain dynamism (SCD).
Finally, Adaptive Capabilities (AC) and Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC)
serve as key mediators in the relationship between AI and SCRes.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Employment to substantiates the
reliability and validity of the determination constructs.

To analyze the significance of the relationships between AI, SCRes and
SCP, Structural path analysis was done.

## Model Fit:

Fit of the model was measured by using Chi square scale (χ2),
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR).

Therefore, the path coefficients were tested using t values and p
values, with p \< 0.05 as the taxing figure for statistical
significance.

Mathematical Model: The relationship between AI capabilities, SCRes, and
SCP is modeled using the following equation:

$$
\text{SCP} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{AI}) + \beta_2(\text{SCRes}) + \beta_3(\text{AC}) + \beta_4(\text{SCC}) + \epsilon
$$

Where: SCP represents Supply Chain Performance AI denotes Artificial
Intelligence capabilities SCRes indicates Supply Chain Resilience AC and
SCC are Adaptive Capabilities and Supply Chain Collaboration
respectively Represents the error term ε

## Significance of work:

This research has important implication in validating empirically on how
innovations powered by AI are an important mechanism for improving
supply chain resilience and performance. By taking into account the
problem of the use of the measured parameters (SCP, SCRes) by the
organization for the reduction of risks and navigation in changing
market conditions, the study links directly and indirectly SCI and AI
with SCP, SCRes. Unlike previous ones focused on short term performance
improvements, this study introduces the use of AI to build the long term
resilience with the strength of adaptive capabilities and cooperation of
the partners in the supply chain. The results highlight the
effectiveness of AI driven predictive analytics, machine learning
models, automation technologies in helping firms take corrective action,
work out response strategies and achieve improved decision making.
Specifically, the research restates that Supply chain dynamism moderates
the use of AI as firms operating in highly volatile markets must fine
tune their use of AI within the practices unique to them. In addition,
this also expands the body of knowledge on digital supply chain
transformation as well as the possible business insights operating on
digital supply chain transformation with the use of AI. Beyond the realm
of academia, their implications are practical advice for supply chain
professionals, policymakers, and technology developers on making use of
AI power for generating resilient and efficient supply chain management.

$$
P(D_t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda (\text{AI}_t + \text{SCRes}_t)}
$$

P(D_t): Probability of disruption at time t. λ (lambda): Sensitivity
factor. This parameter controls how strongly the combined effect of AI
and SCRes influences the probability of disruption. A larger λ means a
greater impact. AI_t: AI capabilities at time t. SCRes_t: Supply chain
resilience at time t. Interpretation: This equation suggests that both
AI capabilities and supply chain resilience reduce the probability of
disruption. The negative exponential function ensures that the
probability is always between 0 and 1. As AI or SCRes increase, the
exponent becomes a larger negative number, making the overall term
closer to zero, and thus P(D_t) closer to zero.

## Connection to Other Work:

However, this study contributes to existing research in several ways.
Empirically testing AI’s role in SCRes and SCP, this extends Grover et
al. (2020) and Dubey et al. (2020). As opposed to existing research on
AI as an optimization tool for short term performance enhancement, this
study emphasizes the role that AI has in creating resilience and thus
long term SCP stability. This supports Scholten et al. (2019) on the
contribution of SC Collaboration and adaptive capabilities to increase
SCRes. The finding provides additional evidence in the digital
transformation and Industry 4.0 research in supply chain management.

## Relevance to Capstone Project:

This paper will be widely applicable for a capstone project pertaining
to an AI driven Supply chain optimization. Specifically: An OIPT and SEM
based research framework is presented so that it can be a basis of
analysis of the impact of AI on supply chain in the real world. The
study also helps in clarifying how AI forecasting and automation
technologies may assist in breaking and raising the efficiency of the
supply chain. The study can also conduct a longitudinal impact of AI
adoption in the supply chains or the comparison of the AI driven
resilience strategies across industries as a potential capstone module.

## Conclusion:

It confirms the strength of AI to make a substantial difference in the
supply chain management. It investigates the ways in which an IT
positive enabler of resilience and long term performance can be
empowered by means of empirical evidence and also on how IT provide can
evolve to achieve those outcomes. These findings can be further extended
by further research of industry specific AI implementation,
establishment of the impact on sustainability or risk mitigation.

This literature review becomes a useful ground for the capstone research
on the supply chain’s digital transformation carried out stemming from
the fact that the future investigation would be in the context of the
digital supply chain transformation.
