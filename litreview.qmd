## Week 2 Research Progress

[@rigatti2017random]
The goal of this paper is to explore and describe
the random forest technique. It provides an overview of the decision
tree process and how random forests are created using decision trees.
The explanations in the article are very useful for understanding the
process. It goes into detail about CART models, how a decision tree is
formed using randomization techniques such as bootstrapping and bagging,
and then randomization at each node. The article briefly explains being
able to tune the model with number of splits and number of trees, which
affect the computational intensity. The article then focuses on using a
random forest to analyze survival data. Colon cancer data is used to
create models using both random forest and Cox, and results are found to
be comparable. The main drawback the author writes of the random forest
as compared to Cox, is that it doesn't give insights into partial
effects of the predictors, making it much more difficult to understand
how the predictors may individually or collectively be influencing the
prediction.

The purpose of this article is to research whether there is an optimal number of trees within a random forest. The goal is to determine if there's a treshold in which increasing the number of trees provides no significant performance gain as compared to the increase of computational cost.
